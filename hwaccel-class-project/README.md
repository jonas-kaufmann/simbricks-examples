# End-To-End Flow for Building HW Accelerators

This subdirectory contains a series of projects we designed for giving students
hands on experience with hardware acceleration from the full system perspective.
The milestones walk students through the steps from an initial software
baseline, all the way to writing and performance testing verilog. At each steps
students can run a complete system, including real application, driver, OS, etc.
thanks to SimBricks.

**These projects are also a great demonstration for how SimBricks can help
accelerate HW design, implementation, and evaluation.**

The project milestones are, in order:
1. [Software Baseline](ms1/README.md)
2. [Behavioral Model for Basic Accelerator with PIO Interface](ms2/README.md)
3. [Improved Hardware-Software Interface](ms3/README.md)
4. [Asynchronous Hardware-Software Interface](ms4/README.md)
5. [Hardware RTL Design](ms5/README.md)

*Please not that this repo only contains the starting points for each
milestone (generous skeleton code with all plumbing), but not the solutions,
since we plan to re-use these course projects again.*

We originally used this projects for https://cms.sic.saarland/hwaccel_23/.

Finally, please feel free to contact Antoine Kaufmann <antoinek@mpi-sws.org> if
you are interested in using these in your teaching.
